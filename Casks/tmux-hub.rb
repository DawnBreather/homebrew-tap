# This file mirrors what GoReleaser writes on release, and it is still written OUTSIDE that run:
# `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` is unset on DawnBreather/tmux-hub, so a release takes its --skip=homebrew branch
# and cannot push here. Set that token and this file becomes generated again.
#
# v0.3.0 was published from the development tree rather than by the workflow, so its four checksums come
# from `sha256sum` over the very archives that were uploaded, matched to their URL by platform rather than
# by position — a hash pasted into the wrong one of four blocks fails as `checksum mismatch` and names
# none of them.
